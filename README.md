# Project Title

The ProSnip tool, developed and described in this report, automates the workflow of SNP annotation from the Whole genome NGS short read data from resequencing projects. The tool primarily runs on python and the GUI runs on TKinter. The user only has to provide the input data and select the database for annotation while the tool carries out all steps automatically  and finally returning the the result at the end of workflow.
